/**
 * Handler Registration - wires all command handlers to the command bus
 * 
 * @deprecated This file is kept for reference only. All functionality has been moved to indexV2.ts.
 * Use registerHandlersV2 from indexV2.ts instead.
 * 
 * This file previously contained legacy PlayerState-based handlers which have been removed.
 * The V2 handlers use GameState and the Actions system.
