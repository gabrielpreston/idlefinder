# Standard Command Structure

## Purpose

[One sentence describing what this command does and when it should be used]

## When to Use

Use this command when:

- [Command-specific scenario 1]
- [Command-specific scenario 2]
- [Command-specific scenario 3]

**Common patterns**:
- A plan/analysis/document has been created and needs [action]
- You need to [specific need]
- You want to ensure [specific goal]

## Prerequisites

Before executing this command, ensure:

- [Command-specific required context or state]
- [Command-specific required tools or dependencies]
- [Command-specific required files or directories exist]

**Common prerequisites**:
- Document exists in expected directory
- Access to codebase, npm scripts, and project documentation
- Ability to read files and execute validation commands

## Reusable Building Blocks & Best Principles

See `.cursor/rules/default-building-blocks.mdc` for complete building block reference.

## AI Execution Steps {#ai-execution-steps}

See `.cursor/rules/default-tool-usage.mdc` for tool usage patterns.

### Phase 1: Context Gathering

1. **Gather required information**
   - Use `read_file` to read: [specific files]
   - Use `codebase_search` to find: [specific patterns or implementations]
   - Use `grep` to locate: [specific code patterns]

2. **Establish codebase context**
   - Use `run_terminal_cmd` to check codebase state
   - Use `read_file` to review relevant configuration files
   - Use `codebase_search` to understand current implementation

### Phase 2: Execution

1. **Perform primary action**
   - Use appropriate tools to: [specific action]
   - Expected outcome: [what should happen]
   - Validation checkpoint: [how to verify success]

2. **Continue with subsequent steps**
   - [Additional execution steps with explicit tool usage]

### Phase 3: Validation

1. **Verify success**
   - Check: [specific criteria]
   - Use appropriate tools to validate: [specific check]

## Error Handling

See `.cursor/rules/default-error-handling.mdc` for common error patterns.

Command-specific errors:
- **[Error Type]**: [How to handle]
  - Detection: [How to identify this error]
  - Resolution: [How to fix or recover]

## Success Criteria {#success-criteria}

- [ ] Criterion 1: [Specific measurable outcome]
- [ ] Criterion 2: [Specific measurable outcome]
- [ ] Criterion 3: [Specific measurable outcome]

**Common success criteria**:
- [ ] Document created/updated in expected location
- [ ] All required sections present
- [ ] Changes validated with `npm run type-check` (at minimum)
- [ ] Status updated appropriately

## Output Format {#output-format}

[Define expected output structure, format, or location]

**Common output formats**:
- Document saved to expected location
- Status updated in document
- Results integrated into document
- Summary report generated

## Notes

- Always use `codebase_search` and `grep` to verify claims before including them
- Cite specific file paths and line numbers when referencing existing patterns
- Check npm script existence before referencing in validation
- Follow project documentation standards
